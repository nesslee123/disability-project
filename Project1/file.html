                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <h2>Students with mobile disabilities are often overlooked and not considered by institutions when designing buildings or routes, which can greatly affect accessibility for these individuals. Here at UCLA, this is especially prominent because there are many hills, stairs, insufficient ramps, malfunctioning elevators, and inconvenient walkways that are not inclusive towards students with mobile impairments. As the Editorial Board of the Daily Bruin describes, “Put simply, this is a human rights issue. It is about time that the demands of the disabled community are not only heard, but acted upon” (Board, E., 2023). Although there have been previous projects aimed at addressing the issue of accessibility throughout the campus of UCLA, like the MetaMap described in the article by UC Tech News where students and staff created “an updated and interactive accessibility dataset to ensure disabled community members have all the information they need to safely and comfortably traverse UCLA”, there still remains a lack of storytelling when it comes to the experiences and voices of the community being represented (UC Tech News, 2021). Given these issues pose a threat to the comfort, safety, and educational experience of students with mobile disabilities, it is important to uplift their stories and provide them with a platform where they can share their perspectives and allow for their voices to be heard. </h2>

                    <h6>Long-Term Impact</h6>
                    <h2>In the future, we hope our website can be used by the Disabled Student Union (DSU) at UCLA to help uplift students with mobile disabilities and provide them with a space of acceptance. We hope our mapplication not only amplifies the voices of those with mobile disabilities at UCLA, but is also able to get back into the hands of the community it aims to serve. This can hopefully allow the community to play an active part in managing this platform in ways that best suit them and their needs. Due to the DSU’s mission to provide students with “a safe and inclusive” environment where they can be empowered, we feel that they would be able to widely benefit from this tool (Desai et al., n.d.). Further, with this tool, the DSU could be more informed about buildings or walkways that are not as inclusive and accessible to students with mobile impairments which could help promote their pursuit to an improved campus for students with disabilities. Once our mapplication is complete, we will reach out to the DSU and provide them with ownership of this tool by making them collaborators on the project and giving them written consent to share the project to empower student voices. Ultimately, we hope this mapplication is used to advocate for the rights of students at UCLA with mobile impairments/disabilities and we feel as though the DSU could benefit from using this tool to “create a community of acceptance at UCLA” (Desai et al., n.d.).</h2>
