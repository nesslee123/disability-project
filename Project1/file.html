                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <h2>There are many instances when the voices of students with mobile disabilities can be overlooked, whether by administration, other groups, or institutions as a whole. Our mapplication is a web-based tool aiming to empower these voices by showcasing the thoughts and experiences of students with mobile impairments in regards to accessibility on UCLA’s campus, as well as incorporating these stories onto our interactive map. We utilized MapLibre to visualize students' responses on a map, allowing users to see the different regions on campus where students either felt positively, negatively, or neutral about accessibility on UCLA’s campus and why they felt that way. Overall, we hope that these stories on our collective map can bring visibility to the perspectives and experiences faced by students with mobile disabilities/impairments.</h2>

                    <h2>We hope to provide ownership of our website to the Disabled Student Union (DSU) in order to keep prioritizing the needs of our peers with mobile disabilities. By doing this, the DSU will be able to continue allowing students to share their experiences for many years to come. Overall, we want to ensure there is a platform where students with mobile impairments are welcomed and feel comfortable sharing their experiences with accessibility on campus.</h2>
