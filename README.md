Tech Stack: Maplibre Gl JS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, GeoJSON, Google Sheets, Google Forms

This mapplication is a web-based tool that we made to showcase the thoughts and experiences of students with mobile impairments in regards to accessibility on UCLA’s campus as well as incorporating these stories onto an interactive map. The site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the data used was based on responses from an online Google Form linked on the site. MapLibre was used to visualize students' responses on a map which allows for people to see the different regions on campus where students either felt positively, negatively, or neutral about accessibility on UCLA’s campus and why they felt that way.

We will provide ownership of this mapplication to the Disabled Student Union (DSU) which will allow for many student voices to be exemplified within this project. The DSU will be able to encorporate more student experiences and reach more students in future years who would be interested in having their experience added to the mapplication. Ultimately, this will allow for many students with mobile disabilities/impairments at UCLA to have a platform where they can share their experiences with accessibility on campus over the course of many years. .
