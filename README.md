    Our platform focuses on sharing the experiences of students with mobile disabilities and their feelings toward accessibility on UCLA's campus. We provide a space where students with mobile impairments feel comfortable sharing their experiences with accessibility throughout campus.

Objectives

    Oftentimes, students with mobile disabilities are overlooked and their voices are not considered by administration or institutions, so we hope to provide a platform for these students to share their experiences and thoughts on accessibility within UCLA’s campus. This allows them to contribute their stories to a collective map. 
    We plan to anonymously survey students with mobile disabilities about their overall feelings on accessibility throughout campus, whether they feel positively, negatively or neutral. We will then ask them to choose which region of campus, either North Campus, South Campus, or the Hill, made them feel this way and have them share their experiences regarding why.  
    We plan to create a website with an interactive map divided into these 3 regions of campus, that will both visualize and showcase the personal stories of different students with mobile disabilities at those locations.

Who Is Empowered?

    We aim to empower and uplift the voices of students with mobile disabilities at UCLA by providing a safe space for them to express their overall thoughts on campus accessibility and share their experiences with specific regions of campus.
    
Technologies Used

    This mapplication is a web-based tool that we made to showcase the thoughts and experiences of students with mobile impairments in regards to accessibility on UCLA’s campus as well as incorporating these stories onto an interactive map. The site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the data used was based on responses from an online Google Form linked on the site. MapLibre was used to visualize students' responses on a map which allows for people to see the different regions on campus where students either felt positively, negatively, or neutral about accessibility on UCLA’s campus and why they felt that way.

How It Can Be Repurposed

    We will provide ownership of this mapplication to the Disabled Student Union (DSU) which will allow for many student voices to be exemplified within this project. The DSU will be able to encorporate more student experiences and reach more students in future years who would be interested in having their experience added to the mapplication. Ultimately, this will allow for many students with mobile disabilities/impairments at UCLA to have a platform where they can share their experiences with accessibility on campus over the course of many years.
